# EDA-Automatidata-Project
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the Automatidata Project.
This project is all about performing EDA practices with Python programming. 
# Main Goal & My Responsibilities: Data Exploration & Visualization

The initial phase of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) project is centered around Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization to gain insights into taxi ridership patterns.
As the newest data professional at Automatidata, my key responsibilities include:

## Explore and Analyze NYC TLC Data
- **Utilizing Python for Data Structuring:** Leveraging Python to organize, clean, and delve into the NYC TLC dataset to unearth key insights.
- **Data Visualization:** Employing libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to craft visual representations that highlight trends and patterns within the data. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Ride duration analysis.
  - understand the Trip and tip characteristics.
 
    This histogram illustrates the trip count and tip amount.

## Develop Tableau Dashboard
- **Interactive Visualization:** Crafting an accessible and interactive Tableau dashboard that illustrates NYC taxi/limo trips by month, represented on a map. This dashboard aims to be:
  - Easily understandable for viewers across all levels of data literacy.
  - Fully accessible, even for individuals with visual impairments, including the assistant director at the NYC TLC.

**Objective:** By fulfilling these tasks, I aim to provide Automatidata and the NYC TLC with a comprehensive understanding of NYC taxi ridership patterns, thereby paving
the way for further analysis and informed decision-making processes.
